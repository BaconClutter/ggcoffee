    <h2>What about getting good coffee</h2>
    <p>
    Get good coffee is a little web project I made because I really like coffee and like to share what I know. I wanted to get together the basics and links to places where anyone can get up and running at home and experience really really good coffee without all the fuss that comes with some parts of the high end coffee world.
