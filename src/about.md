            Get good coffee is a little web project I made because I really like coffee and want to share the things I've learned. Also, I really could never find a list of all of these Third Wave roasters, so that was the main thing. I figured while I'm here, throw together a few basics on making coffee and some links so anyone can get up and running at home and experience really, really good coffee without all the fuss that comes with some parts of the high end coffee world.

                Got a favorite roaster you don't see? Drop me a line. Just wanna rap about tasty hot bean water? Something look wrong or off here? Constructive criticism is always welcome. I'd love to hear from you.
