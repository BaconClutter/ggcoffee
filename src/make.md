            <h2>Grind your beans</h2>
            <p>
            Grinding beans well is probably the most noticeable thing you can do to make better coffee at home. This all comes down to consistent surface area during extraction (brewing). If all of the ground beans are more or less the same shape and size, then the water will pull the same amount of flavor out of each little piece. If they are wildly different in size, then the larger chunks will not produce as much flavor, and a bunch of super tiny pieces will over extract and your brew can become bitter and sour quickly, ruining those fancy beans you just bought.
            </p>
            <p>
            Many people start with blade grinders. I did, and I didn’t realize what I was missing until I had some coffee from a burr grinder. The blades cut and shatter your beans in unpredictable ways. Burr grinders make clean consistent pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
            Get a burr grinder. There are nice <a href="https://www.oxo.com/oxo-brew-manual-coffee-grinder.html">hand grinders</a> if you don’t mind a little manual labor in the morning, and pretty decent options on the economic end of the spectrum like this <a href="https://www.baratza.com/en-us/product/encore-zcg485"> Baratza Encore</a>.

            <h2>Brew your coffee</h2>
            <p>
            There's a few ways to do this but the simplest way to get the most out of your fancy beans is immersion brewing. The French press is great for this.</p>
            <p>
            Brewing can get really specific but it's really not all that complicated. One of the most important things to do for consistent, great tasting coffee at home is measuring the amount of beans and the amount water because getting the ratio of ingredients right. Much like with baking, measuring makes all the difference in the end quality.
            </p>
            <p>
            The next great way to make great coffee is by doing pour overs at home. The actual brewer can be extremely simple and cheap (link to origami) (link to V60). But some of the extra pieces that make the difference add a little bit of overhead to getting it right. This is where an electric gooseneck kettle really makes a difference. This is always about controlling the flow of water.

            There is so much more to talk about with brewing and so many other ways to do it...

            <h2>Store your beans</h2>
            <p>
            Once you open your beans, you can probably leave them in the bag they came in as long as it’s resealable. If not, you should move them to any clean, airtight container (ziplock, mason jar, etc.). There are also special vacuum containers available from OXO, or Fellow that can help keep your beans fresher longer.
            </p>

            <h3>*&nbsp;Resting</h3>
                <p>
                Coffee bean (especially light roast) flavor will fully develop a few weeks after roasting.
                </p>
                <p>
                Many roasters will note this on their website or on their coffee bags, but if not, this is still probably a valuable step to get the best flavor our of your beans. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Of course, your coffee will taste great even a day or 2 after roasting, but for maximum enjoyment the community seems to think resting really makes a difference.
